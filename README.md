# Automated Machine Learning Pipeline with Scheduled Retraining

## Project Description
This project implements an automated ML pipeline where the model is retrained periodically using a scheduler. Model performance is evaluated after every retraining cycle and stored for historical comparison.

## Features
- Automated data preprocessing
- Scheduled model retraining
- Performance evaluation
- Accuracy history tracking

## Scheduling
Retraining is triggered weekly using GitHub Actions cron scheduling.

## Benefits
- Continuous model improvement
- Performance monitoring over time
- Fully automated ML workflow
